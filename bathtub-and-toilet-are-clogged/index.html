            <p>One of the biggest issues in bathtub drains is hair, especially if anyone in your house has long hair. Licensed master plumber teaches you how to unclog a toilet in 11 seconds with a simple plunger.</p>


<p><strong>Bathtub And Toilet Are Clogged</strong> A plunger will help you unclog the toilet and get rid of the objects that are blocking the pipes, as well as the extra air that’s stuck in there. This causes negative air pressure inside the drainpipe/vent which is forced out through the toilet in form of bubbles. When your toilet is backed up every discharge, this is a sign that the obstacle may be on the main sewer line. You should do it with a piece of tape, and you need to be sure that it’s closed tightly so the air can’t go in or out.</p>
