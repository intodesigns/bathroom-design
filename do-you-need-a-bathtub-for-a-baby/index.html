<p><strong>Do You Need A Bathtub For A Baby</strong> You don’t necessarily need a baby bathtub—you can simply sit in your tub with your newborn on your lap, but once she’s able to sit on her own ( hello, baby milestone ), she can splish and splash on her own. To begin with you may find it easier to use the kitchen sink or a small plastic baby bath. Of course, you should only have a small amount of water in there and always keep your hands on your baby, but hopefully i don’t need to remind you of that. Babies don’t always need “immersion” baths anyway.</p>
