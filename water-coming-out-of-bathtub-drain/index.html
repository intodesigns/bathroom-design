So when the water is draining from the tub, the air that is supposed to be going through the vent ends up coming up through the toilet drain, which causes the bubbling. Generally speaking, this issue is caused by a problem in the main sewer line. The displaced air will force its way out through the bottom of the toilet bowl. When you start draining the bathtub, the water will displace the air in the drainpipe. Generally, the smell is worse during the day than it is at night.</p>
