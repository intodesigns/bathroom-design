<p><strong>Putting A Toaster In A Bathtub</strong> As the name implies, the gfic only functions if a circuit has a ground fault. Amperage and not voltage is what kills a person. You can’t reliably murder someone by tossing a toaster into the bathtub. In this case, if you throw a toaster in the bathtub, the electricity will flow back to the toaster and then to the circuit.</p>
