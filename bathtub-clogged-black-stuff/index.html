<p>Bathtub refinishing is the process of restoring the surface of an old bathtub to improve the bathtub’s appearance and repair surface damage. The best way to do this is to call a plumber out who can run a snake as far as is needed to clear the drain and who could run a camera down the drain to inspect the clog or drain pipe if needed. Readjust the linkage if necessary. Expansion tanks have a rubber bladder in them, and yes, it could be bad as well.they do eventually wear out. If your bathtub is still clogged, you can try plunging the drain. Using a plunger or a drain auger should clear the clog out and stop more black stuff coming out of sink or black water coming out of tub drain.</p>
