<p><strong>Acrylic Vs Enameled Steel Bathtub</strong> That’s why cast iron tubs tend to require extra floor supports. Rust may be visible in chips if the tub is made of metal. Cast iron tubs last for 70 years or more. Porcelain tubs are typically heavier than acrylic bathtubs yet lighter than enameled cast iron.</p>

<p>Enamel finish helps bath to retain colour and avoid discoloration. The quality and value of the steel bath depend on its working surface, that is, on the enamel coating. It is therefore classed as a highly robust material, and since it is harder even than steel, enamel is virtually impossible to scratch with materials used in the bathroom.</p>
