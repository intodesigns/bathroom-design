The poor caller had been tricked by family members, who had put a toy alligator in the bath and pretended they collected it from nearby bushes. You were only let out when pepper found hawkeye rolling around, you got him back though. The remote control lets you easily navigate the alligator head around ponds, lakes, rivers, and more using two joysticks. This is in a wildlife preserve not a zoo.</p>
