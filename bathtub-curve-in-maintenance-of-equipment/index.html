<p>Bathtub curve Passionate About OSS and BSS It allows us to clearly map three distinct phases in the asset’s life cycle, as you can see below. It consists of three main periods: Early failure, useful life, and wear. It has proven to be particularly appropriate for electronic equipment and systems. In concept, the bathtub curve effectively demonstrates a machine’s three basic failure rate characteristics:</p>

<p>6 The bathtub curve for the probability of hardware This curve simply represents overall life cycle of assets and failure rate of overall population of assets over time. Equipment has a failure and needs maintenance. In many cases, this machinery is under a predictive maintenance program that uses technologies such as vibration, thermography or oil analysis. From its shape, the curve can be divided into three distinct: When using.</p>

<p>Bathtub curve for a repairable system Download Choosing to replace a part too soon increases the failure rate on the equipment as the infant mortality drives up the failure rate. By far the largest percentage of hardware failures occur during the first 30 days of installation. While there is much truth in the premise, there is more to the story.
