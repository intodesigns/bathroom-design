Our first stop en route to chipping campden was a short visit to castle coombe, a small village not too far from bath that has been called the prettiest village in england (although there are a lot of villages that claim that title), and which happens to be a favorite of my father. It is a less costly alternative to replacing a bathtub;</p>

<p>It may take several hours for the stripping agent to attack the coating to scrap off and in some cases only softens the coating enough. Use a good paint brush or small roller to paint the bath tub. If you knock on the side of the tub and the material has a little give, your tub is likely fiberglass or acrylic. Sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one. Seriously though, i don�t think (though i do not know this) bathing in paint chips is dangerous, unless you drink the bath water and the paint chips. However, the process often involves the use of hazardous chemicals including methylene chloride, acids, and isocyanates.</p>
