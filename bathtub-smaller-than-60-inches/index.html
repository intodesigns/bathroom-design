<p>This is because there needs to be space around the outside of the freestanding tub to allow for access to clean, etc. We have 57.5 to work with, no option to extend it for those precious few inches. A tub over 60 inches long won’t fit in most of the standard alcoves, but if you’re already moving a wall or building a new house, why not get a bigger tub?</p>

<p>Extra wide bathtubs take more space than regular bathtubs, so it is anything larger than these numbers. Many bathrooms are designed specifically for alcove installation and have three walls set up with the exact dimensions of a standard alcove tub, which nimvo says is 60 inches long and 30 inches wide. The standard alcove bathtub is 60 inches long, 32 inches wide, and 19 inches high.
