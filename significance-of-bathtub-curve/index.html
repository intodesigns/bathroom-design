<p>Tech�s ticking time bombs The components you might (and This is the well known “bathtub curve,” which, over the years, has become widely accepted by the reliability community. It describes one particular form of a hazard function which is further divided into three sections as follows: This data helps manufacturers predict when failures happen and hopefully identify root causes and prevent them. The bathtub curve is used in reliability,.</p>
