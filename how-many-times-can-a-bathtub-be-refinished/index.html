<p><strong>How Many Times Can A Bathtub Be Refinished</strong> How many times should bath tubs and sinks need to be refinished in less than ten years? Bathtub refinishing is the process of restoring the surface of an old bathtub to improve the bathtub’s appearance and repair surface damage. When properly done, a reglazed bathtub can look just like new and with proper care. The process can damage flooring, bathroom walls, and plumbing, all while putting your bathroom out of service for many days or even weeks.</p>
