<p><strong>Diy Bathtub Paint Toddler</strong> She has also made diy chalk paint.

<p>Mixing art with food is a great thing. Add a squirt of dish soap to help with. I squirted shaving foam into a muffin tray and then mixed in a tiny bit of gel food colouring into each section. I mixed up some bath paints using 2 simple ingredients, shaving foam and food colouring. Carefully add and then stir in the glow in the dark powder to each. For example, in your mixing bowl, add 2 tablespoons bubble bath and 1/4 cup of water or 1/4 cup bubble bath and 1/2 cup water.</p>
