<p><strong>Bathtub Filling With Sewage</strong> If the toilet and bathtub are in the same bathroom, their drains usually connect. This is why it’s a wonder for homeowners when they see sewage water coming up through the bathtub or shower drain. When your plumbing systems are in working order, your bathtub drains tub and shower water down your pipes and into your sewer. A couple days ago i did a load of laundry and noticed that the bathtub was full of sewage about 45mins after starting the laundry load.</p>

Oh Poo! Sewage Coming Up Through Bathtub From mrrooter.com</p>

<p>A sewer line clog can be caused by tree roots, flushed items, or grease buildup. If you want to stop your toilet from bubbling, you need to remove the blockage so all the liquid and air from all the drains can flow freely and go where they’re intended to go. When raw sewage or questionable water is in your bathtub, the problem lies not with your bathtub itself, but with what’s beneath it—your sewer line. Tenant sabrina dixon stands in front of a bathtub filled with raw sewage in her apartment at bay crossings apartments in hancock county, where toilets began backing up. If the main sewer line is backed up, this could lead to water building up in your shower. If your septic tank keeps filling up with water, this is because your filtered water sewage has nowhere to go.</p>
