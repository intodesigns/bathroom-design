Bath liners are basically an acrylic replica of your existing bathtub — except, you can change the color and skirt style if you want — and they�re relatively easy to install. Professional bathtub replacement costs an average of $3,600. After your first round of cleaning is finished, sand the entire tub and tile area with 400 (or 600) grit sandpaper.
