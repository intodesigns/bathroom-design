<p><strong>Bathtub Black Spots</strong> If you see black specks when you turn on your hot water in the tub, shower, or sink, your water heater is likely corroding, or the water lines to and from the water heater are corroded. You won’t see any new black spots if you keep the air dry, so you can focus on dealing with the ones already there. Stubborn bathtub stains are usually the result of the porcelain or the baked on enamel wearing out, leaving the surface etched. Steam from hot showers and bathtubs rises to the ceiling, and without proper ventilation it can settle there.</p>
