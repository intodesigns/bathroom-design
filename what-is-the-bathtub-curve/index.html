<p>The bathtub curve is a diagram model made to speak to the disappointing pace of a gathering of items over some undefined time frame. The bathtub curve consists of three periods: The vertical axis is the failure rate at each point in time and the horizontal axis is the test time (or the time since the product was released for sale to the public).</p>

The initial region that begins at time zero when a customer first begins to use the product is characterized by a high but rapidly decreasing failure rate. This is the bathtub curve we are often shown. Because of the shape of this failure rate curve,.</p>
