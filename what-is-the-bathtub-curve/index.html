<p>The bathtub curve is a diagram model made to speak to the disappointing pace of a gathering of items over some undefined time frame. The bathtub curve consists of three periods: The vertical axis is the failure rate at each point in time and the horizontal axis is the test time (or the time since the product was released for sale to the public).</p>
