<p><strong>Bathtub Gin Drink Recipe</strong> Bathtub gin, created in the days of america�s prohibition of alcohol is a crude version of this recipe that was in private homes for consumption in hidden backrooms and speakeasies. Another variation has it shaken for almost a minute to get a nice foam on the egg, and then add ice, shake a few more times, strain and serve. If you want to make one flavor stand out, add more of that desired ingredient, then close the jar and steep for another 12 hours. Gin was chosen because, unlike whiskey, it did not need to be aged for a long period of time, allowing it to be ready to consume in a short period of time.</p>
