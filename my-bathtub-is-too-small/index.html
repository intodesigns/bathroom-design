Whether you’re a family with small children or a bathtub is an essential for you, a more compact size bathtub might be the answer you are looking for.</p>

<p>Position the shower against the longest side of the bath; We are starting the process of enlarging a very small master bath similar to yours. Basically i loved the old one. Have a gap at the end of the bath (you will also need a side bath panel) build something to fill it in: Tea for two and parity will give you just under 14” of water depth.
