<p><strong>Easy To Get In And Out Of Bathtubs</strong> Once your body is hovering over the bathtub you can then lower yourself down into the tub, again using your arms. Because they are complex to make, freestanding tubs are generally at the higher end of the range. Some charities will come to your home and pick up the item. The price range varies considerably depending on the size of the tub and the material you choose.</p>

<p>When entering the bath, hold onto the ledge and place one leg over while squatting down slightly to lower your center of gravity. Easy access baths make bathing fun and enjoyable again. A bath bench, for example, will extend over the edge of a traditional bathtub, allowing the bather to slide in and out of the tub.</p>

<p>What i do now, which is not so safe, is to get on my knees in the widest part of the tub, then stand and hold on carefully on the exterior side of the tub where i have a towel for traction,but i�m looking for a better solution. My cousin carved a shower space out of her kitchen and added a toilet as well. As an older adult, you will likely have trouble getting in/out of a tub at some point (future surgeries and stability issues). I love that this transfer bend is customisable to the height of the bath and the person using it. Rails are available in various lengths, so you should find something to suit your requirement. Safely getting out of a bathtub is especially important for older people who live alone and for those who recently had surgery.</p>
