<p>In my home i was able to cut open the back wall of a closet to get to the rear of the bath/shower valve. Do this by lifting up and tilting back (kitchen handles) or sliding out from the wall (baths/showers). Usually, you’ll only need an allen wrench, at least if you’re dealing with a similar delta shower valve</p>

<p>In short, this means if there is not equal pressure on the hot and cold sides of the valve, no water will come out and you won’t be accidentally scalded by unexpected hot water. In this video, we�re replacing a two handle kitchen faucet. These pressure balancing valves have very fine ports and channels the will be blocked and clogged by the smallest installation debris that is impossible to remove. Sometimes these bathroom tub fixtures are easy to replace, but other times they can be quite difficult to change. These do not have flexible hoses like a regular bathroom sink faucet. The tub will be glued/screwed in somehow and there will be no way to lift it.</p>
