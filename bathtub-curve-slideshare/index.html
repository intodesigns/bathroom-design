<p>Probabilistic design for reliability (pdfr) in electronics So basically, it is assumed that most product follow a particular trend during their life cycle which relates their failure rate with time. True, some devices may follow its general shape, but the fact is that more has been assumed along those lines than has actually been measured and proven to be the case.
