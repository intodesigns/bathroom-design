<p><strong>Can You Sell A House Without A Bathtub</strong> Hi, we having been living without a bathtub for about a year now. The benefit of a shower bath over a regular straight bath is that it is slightly wider at the showering end, to give you more room when taking a shower. At times, sellers can upgrade their property beyond what it is worth in relation to the surrounding area. If the seller failed to disclose unpermitted renovation work at the time of the sale, and you incurred damages remedying the problem, you may be able to file a civil suit against them or reach a settlement agreement.</p>

Revamping Your Master Bathroom Peter Mickus From petermickus.com</p>
<p>Even if you don’t use the bath often, it is well worth keeping one to maximise the return potential on your house value when it comes to selling your home. However, a buyer will most likely not offer $90,000 for the home. For instance, when the house is listed for sale, those who require a tub will see it missing from the listing and won’t bother to see the house.</p>
