<p>So when the water is draining from the tub, the air that is supposed to be going through the vent ends up coming up through the toilet drain, which causes the bubbling. My toilet is clogged and i tried using a snake, but it�s not working. It may be due to a blockage somewhere in the vent pipe. To clear a clog that sits in a branch pipe, remove the toilet that sits nearest the bathtub from its mount on the floor. However, if you attempt to unclog by flushing the toilet and using a plunger, you might actually push the clog further down the drain. Water backs up to your sink, bathtub, shower, or commode.</p>
