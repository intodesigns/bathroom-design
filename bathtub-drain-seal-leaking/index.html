Although caulking directly around the bathtub drain can help eliminate water leaks, this type of seal won�t help insulate your tub area from leaky air that enters through large gaps around the exterior sides of the drainage pipe. The drain is constantly exposed to water, soap, germs and moisture than may cause mold or rust over time if the drain is not sealed properly.</p>
