<p><strong>Do You Put Tile Under Bathtub</strong> In fact, tiles look amazing under the clawfoot tub which is just a type of freestanding tub. Bathrooms were frequently 1/2 plywood subfloor, a 1 mud bed with wire mesh and then tile. A fiberglass tub can bounce, so you need to support it under the tub. Consider tiling an extra tile under the tub, and using kerdi membrane under the tile floor near the tub, and then just leaving enough membrane sticking out past the last row of tiles under the tub, that you can use it later when you or someone removes that tub.</p>

<p>No one knows (or cares) that the tile isn�t under the tub. As was said by hj, no real reason to do it nor any overpowering reason to do it. Look under the tub and you should see a gap where you would stand while showering. Buy enough spare tiles now while they are available and all from the same lot. Take into account the thickness of the backing board and the tiles, and set up wooden supports under the bath that will support the backing board. In fact, tiles look amazing under the clawfoot tub which is just a type of freestanding tub.</p>

<p>Tile Around bathtub. Over drywall vs. vapor shield It�s much easier &amp; less chance of damaging the bath. Some people also throw a 2x4 in the sapce as well. Use a spacer along the edge of the tub (a couple of old yard sticks will do) to create a uniform grout line between the tile and the tub. Do you put tile floor down before cabinets? Buy enough.</p>

<p>How to Tile Bathroom Walls and Shower/Tub Area howtos DIY Is the norm to tile the whole floor, then put the freestanding bath on top of the tiles? The bathtub is resting on 1/4 plywood over the subfloor. If you have the luxury of not needing to use the bath, then tile before you put it in.
