<p>Walter knows that an acid such as hydrofluoric acid (hf) will be able to dissolve the bodies as it can destroy tissue and decalcify bone, so he steals a few large bottles of hf from his high school chemical stores. Failure to treat a hydrofluoric acid spill on the skin can result in serious acid burns and even death. It isnât a strong acid because it doesnât completely separate from water. Ignoring whiteï¿½s instructions, pinkman put koyamaï¿½s body in his. The hf processes have no mechanical stirring as in the sulphuric acid processes. Additionally, how long does hydrofluoric acid take to dissolve a body?</p>
