Other uses of composite materials based on the characteristics of composite material include in construction of buildings and bridges, making of the space shuttles, boats, bathtubs, storage tanks, racing cars, aircraft. Reinforced concrete, wooden composite materials. Cast polymer bathtub materials include engineered natural stone and solid surface materials. Composite materials are generally used for buildings, bridges, and structures such as boat hulls, swimming pool panels, racing car bodies, shower stalls, bathtubs, storage tanks, imitation granite, cultured marble sinks, and countertops.
