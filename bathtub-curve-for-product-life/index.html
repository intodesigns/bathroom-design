<p>Technology life cycle cost ‘Bathtub curve’. Download Bathtub curve the bathtub curve is typically used as a visual model to illustrate the three key periods of product failure rate and not calibrated to depict a graph of the expected behavior for a particular product family. Below is the diagram of bathtub curve. This information enables manufacturers to anticipate when failures occur and ideally distinguish main drivers and.</p>
