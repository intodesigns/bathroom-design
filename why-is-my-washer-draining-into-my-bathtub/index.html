<p><strong>Why Is My Washer Draining Into My Bathtub</strong> In either case, you probably have a clog in the drainage pipe after the two combine. If your bathtub or shower backs up when you flush the toilet, almost always it is because your sewer line or main house drain is clogged. This blockage may be anywhere in the home’s plumbing, potentially forcing the dishwasher, washing machine or bathroom sink to back up into the tub. When the main house drainpipe is partially clogged, the bathtub/shower will back up then the water will drain slowly after sometime.</p>

<p>If a blockage in the main sewer line is the cause of water backing up into the bathtub or other related plumbing issues—or even if you simply suspect it might be the cause—the best thing you can do is to call a reputable plumber to come to assess the problem as soon as possible. A couple days ago when my washing machine was draining, i heard water gurgling in the bathroom. The ultimate cause of household bathtub shower drain clogs is actually a combination of all the aforementioned common causes—hair, hard water deposits, soap scum, dirt and debris. Yes, only when you have a septic system and there is no gray water line. When you start draining the bathtub, the water will displace the air in the drainpipe. A laundry sink has uses, but is now uncommon as it also takes up extra space.</p>
