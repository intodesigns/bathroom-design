Bathtub The Bathtub Curve From bathtubdzumizuka.blogspot.com</p>
<p>This is the well known “bathtub curve,” which, over the years, has become widely accepted by the reliability community. A bathtub curve is a visual representation of the failure rate of a product or group of products over time. Time is the horizontal dimension on which the bathtub curve is built and not the phase.</p>

<p>The Bathtub Curve as Applied to Pumping Systems Pumps In this proposed alternate approach to studying reliability, interdisciplinary boundaries are crossed as links between the fields of reliability engineering, quality control and. Time goes from left to right as usual, and the vertical access measures the failure rate. Note that it displays the three failure rate patterns. Thus, it is a description of various failure rates for products over.</p>
