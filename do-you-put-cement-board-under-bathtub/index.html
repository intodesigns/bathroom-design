            <p>I am converting a bedroom into a bathroom. The cement board has to be placed a bit above the lip of the bathtub so that the tub or its lip is not damaged.</p>


<p><strong>Do You Put Cement Board Under Bathtub</strong> The best approach when installing cement board or other tile backer around a tub is to keep the cement board out of the lip area. In my own new bathroom of about the same size as yours, i ran the cement board under the tub as far as the second sheet would go (a few inches), then installed the tile to a point just inside the skirt of the tub. Is this a good idea. I dont put cement backerboard under tubs.</p>

<p>There was no insulation in the wall. I will definitely need to put the plywood under the bathtub, but do i need to install the cement. It prevents water from leaking onto the backer board. I suggest shimming the studs (only if you have to) to get the cement board down over the tub lip. The existing surface should be removed first prior to the installation of the cement board. Cement board is a pain to work with and liquid nails gets mixed reviews adhering to it.</p>
