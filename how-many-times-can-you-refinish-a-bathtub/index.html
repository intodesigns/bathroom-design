<p><strong>How Many Times Can You Refinish A Bathtub</strong> If applied correctly, a refinished bathtub should last 10 to 15 years before requiring another refinishing. On the other hand, removing a bathtub is a difficult and messy job. We taped all around the edge where the paint would meet the porcelain, and around the holes on the end where the faucets would eventually be installed. As an alternative, you can always install a tub liner instead.</p>

<p>Likewise, can a bathtub be refinished twice? Bathtub reglazing can be done more than once, though the prep work involved in reglazing a tub that has been previously reglazed can be more extensive and therefore more expensive. We can also fix these areas by leveling the shower or tub bottom creating a rebuilt, leak proof floor.</p>

<p>In this post, i am going to give you the honest truth by sharing how my painted bathtub is holding up after five yearsâ¦. If itï¿½s a solid 3/4 tongue and groove floor chances are great you wonï¿½t be around to sand down to the nailing area, as it will take approx 1/4 to reach. However, the process often involves the use of hazardous chemicals including methylene chloride, acids, and isocyanates. And believe it or not, the ugly color wasnât even the worst thing about the old tile floors. Over time fiberglass bottoms can weaken and crack. We offer bathtub refinishing (reglazing, recoating), countertop refinishing, shower refinishing, spot repair, tile refinishing, etc.</p>
