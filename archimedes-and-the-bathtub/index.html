<p>Archimedes grappled with this problem but was unable to find a solution to this tricky dilemma, however hard he tried. We do know what plagiarism is and avoid it by any means. It was still on his mind one day as he stepped into his bathtub. The story that he determined the proportion of gold and silver in a wreath made for hieron by weighing it in water is probably true, but the version that has him leaping from the bath in which he supposedly got the idea and running naked through the streets shouting “heurēka!” (“i have found it!”) is popular embellishment. Archimedes came upon the solution on how to prove this as he was taking a bath. The latter, while the case was still on his mind, happened to go to the bath, and on getting into a tub observed that the more his body sank into it the more water ran out over the tub.</p>

The water he splashed out of the tub when he got in was equal to the volume taken up by his body. Archimedes mulled over the problem. The latter, while the case was still on his mind,.</p>
