<p>Time is the horizontal dimension on which the bathtub curve is built and not the phase. One of the best known mathematical approaches to derive ber is the dual dirac method. People, and other organic species for that matter, tend to suffer a high failure rate (mortality) during their first years of life, particularly the first few years, but the rate decreases as the child grows older. The vertical axis is the failure rate at each point in time and the horizontal axis is the test time (or the time since the product was released for sale to the public). The movement of carbon from reservoir to reservoir is known as the carbon cycle. It has proven to be particularly appropriate for electronic equipment and systems.</p>
