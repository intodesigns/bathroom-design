<p><strong>How To Remove Bathtub Strainer</strong> If you locate a lever at the back of your tub, lifting it should remove the stopper for you. Unscrew the bathtub drain flange, which is the part of the drain you see on the bottom of the tub, after first unscrewing and removing the strainer if there is one. If the flange has crossbars, loosen it with a tool called a drain key, which hooks onto the crossbars and has holes that allow you to insert a screwdriver to use as a handle. The first step in your process is to figure out how to remove this stopper.</p>
