<p>Kept getting more bites so i just sprayed my bed down in bed bug spray. However, they do seem to be more common during spring and summer (although this also depends on the climate you live in). Ok, i�ve noticed collections of small (half a grain of rice) sized light brown bugs appearing in my bathtub. Both drain flies and earwigs naturally breed during the summer. These flies can also breed inside of drains that have accumulations of organic matter or any other area where water and organic decay. Sink bugs, bathtub bugs, eyelash bugs, or house centipedes?</p>
