<p><strong>Baby Hit Head On Bathtub</strong> She�s now a perfect 2yr old :) no worries mama, these things happen! Those goose eggs are really just big bruises. What are the symptoms of a concussion in a baby? If your child takes a hit to the head, cries for a minute, but then goes right back to playing, you can probably breathe easy.</p>

Is a £60 an hour spa for babies the pottiest idea ever From dailymail.co.uk</p>
<p>To help the bump go down, wrap an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas, in a pinch) in a thin towel or diaper and hold it on the bump for two to five minutes at a time, off and on, for an hour. In most cases, “watch and wait” (with lots of extra tlc) is the most appropriate course of action after a baby’s minor head bump. In this case, the hitting may be a way to achive distraction and mitigate the pain.</p>

Your baby toddles into a wall, whacks their head on the side of a crib, or gets beaned in the head by a wooden block their sibling threw (you know, innocently). “first off, don’t panic if you see a lot of blood,” says dr. Any loss of consciousness or deformity of the skull after a baby hits her head requires immediate medical attention, says ash singhal, a paediatric neurosurgeon at the bc children’s hospital in vancouver. Whatever the cause of a head injury, how you assess whether your child should see a doctor or go to the emergency room is the same. These accidental bumps rarely cause major head injuries, such as concussions , which are injuries to the brain caused by a forceful knock on the head.</p>
