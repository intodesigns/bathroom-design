Age is not as important a factor as is size, but even if a baby still fits in the bassinet it may no longer be the appropriate choice. You can help babies get used to the big bath by putting the small baby bath into the big bath a few times. If you don’t have the type of sink that would fit your baby, you may need to stick to the bathtub or find a baby product that makes bathing your baby in the sink possible.</p>
