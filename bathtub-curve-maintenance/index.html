<p>Short note on bathtub curve. You might call it “running it’s course”. As i told you in bathtub curve and maintenance timing, the manufacturers should know it! Bathtub curve reliability and how repairs affect it after we repair a device, one of the frequent concerns our customers have is about the reliability of the product itself. It allows us to clearly map three distinct phases in the asset’s life cycle, as you can see below. This curve simply represents overall life cycle of assets and failure rate of overall population of assets over time.</p>
