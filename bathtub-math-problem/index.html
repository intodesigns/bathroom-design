<p><strong>Bathtub Math Problem</strong> In windows nt 4 and possibly 2000, the limitation is even worse: The items were designed to be simple, and can be answered without use of mathematics beyond high school (primarily simple arithmetic). The cold tap takes 2 minutes and the water empties through the plug hole in 4 minutes. In windows nt 4 and possibly 2000, the limitation is even worse:</p>

Much smaller bathtubs can only hold around 40 gallons (150 liters) of water, which typically are more suited for smaller children or function more as a shower space. Cold rate for 1 bath = 1/3 b/m b = bath m=minutes. After all, the bathtub catches the drips and they don’t cause wet flooring or mold to appear, so what’s the big deal?</p>

There is a severe limitation in batch math: Explain the meaning of each statement in this situation. Participants were asked to respond by drawing a graph of the expected behavior over time. How many minutes did cole read altogether?</p>
