<p><strong>How To Keep Water Warm In Bathtub</strong> Since most of the heat escapes from the top of the tub, it’s highly recommended that you keep the cover on the hot tub while the water’s heating up. Pull the shower curtain or tub door closed to keep warmth inside the bathtub area. By preheating hot stones and adding them to your bath, they’ll slowly release heat into the water as you bathe, keeping the water hot for the entirety of your bath. By operating the tub heater only when hot water is needed and reheating without using a storage tank, you are able to save energy and utility costs.</p>
