<p><strong>What Should I Use To Seal My Bathtub</strong> Block holes around the tub drain with sheet goods and spray foam. I was planning on putting caulk around the base of my bath/shower, but i have been told by someone that it is preferable not to seal the bottom of a bath as it prevents it from being able to breath (which i assume, but don�t know for sure, means they are saying any moisture under the unit will not be able to evaporate). Make sure to remove and clean all mould or mildew with a mould remover. Fill gaps larger than 1/8 inch with a sanded caulk.</p>
