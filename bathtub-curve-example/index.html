<p><strong>Bathtub Curve Example</strong> Bathtub curve profiles the failure rate of a large sample of components or a large sample of systems as they age. A real bathtub curve would capture all the different types of failure modes, represented by each of these lines. As can be seen, a bathtub curve consists of three different failure rates: The bathtub curve describes the relative failure rate of a large number of products over time.</p>

It has proven to be particularly appropriate for electronic equipment and systems.

<p>Typical &quot; Bathtub &quot; Curve of Hardware Reliability This is what a real bathtub curve looks like. This is the bathtub curve we are often shown. The open circuit can also be caused by some other failure mechanism, for example by electromigration. Products fail at different rates, creating a failure distribution (see. Figure 2) that may or may not be a normal distribution.</p>

This curve simply represents overall life cycle of assets and failure rate of overall population of assets over time. An oxide breakdown, for example, can lead to a short or to an open circuit.
