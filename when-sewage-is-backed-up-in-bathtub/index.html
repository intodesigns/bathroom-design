            <p>Sewage backups are among the worst problems that homeowners can face. A toilet that works correctly drains into the sewer line in your house out to your main sewer.</p>


<p><strong>When Sewage Is Backed Up In Bathtub</strong> You should get a plumber out asap since main sewer line clogs can be expensive to fix and can be hazardous to you and your family’s health since sewage can get in the shower.

Luckily, this problem is easy to fix.</p>
