<p>Every renovation project doesn�t have to break the bank If you think a broken stopper could be the reason why you cannot drain the bathtub, check to see if the stopper is stuck or blocked. If the stopper doesn�t open, you can usually fix it by lengthening, not shortening, the linkage. A stopper that isn’t flush with the bottom of the tub when it’s engaged may not hold water.</p>

The drain fixture is just a grate (can�t get a snake through).

After fiddling with the lever more i was still unable.</p>
