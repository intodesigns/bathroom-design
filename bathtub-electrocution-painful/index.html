<p><strong>Bathtub Electrocution Painful</strong> Currents of less than 0.2 ma will not cause a skin injury or death by electrocution but are sufficient to evoke a startle reaction and may precipitate a lethal accident, such as a fall. In this study 41 cases of death by electrocution in the bathtub were investigated. In march 2017, a british man was electrocuted while bathing and holding an iphone that was being charged. Know that any amount of current over 10 milliamps (0.01 amp) is capable of producing painful to severe shock, and currents between 100 and 200 ma (0.1 to 0.2 amp) are fatal.</p>
